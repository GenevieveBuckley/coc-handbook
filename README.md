# Django Events Code of Conduct Incident Handling

## About
This is a document used by Django: Under the Hood and DjangoCon Europe 2016 Code of Conduct teams to handle any incidents occurring during those events.

It's a very early draft, and things change as we learn more about things that work for us.

Feel free to use it to learn about our process, or to implement similar process in your community.

### Be prepared
It’s important to prepare yourself and your team -- this will give you confidence to handle any issues without unnecessary stress.

- Make sure it’s clear to everyone in the organization team who are the people responsible for receiving the incident reports (“Code of Conduct Team”). This should be ideally a team of two people, a man and a woman.
- Make sure it’s clear to everyone in the organization who is responsible for handling incidents -- from taking the initial report, through making a decision and informing everyone of the action taken. This should ideally be the Code of Conduct Team, and the Conference Chair (or Chairs). Keep this group small.
- Make sure everyone in your team is aware of the procedure outlined here, and knows how to proceed if needed.
- Before the conference, send your list of attendees to the Django Software Foundation committee and other Django events organizers to help you spot potential risks (people who have harassed or created a problem before). Proceed with this guideline if needed.

### Training
It’s important that conference volunteers in different roles are trained in how to handle Code of Conduct incidents and what to do when one occurs. These tips can be helpful:

- Conduct a meeting with all volunteers to brief them on the policies and what they need to know.
- Consider having some role-playing to help people practice responding to people who disclose a Code of Conduct violation. Giving people a chance to practice what they would say can be really helpful for them, and also ensure that anyone who discloses a Code of Conduct violation has a positive experience.
- Create a one-page flyer to be kept at the registration desk with the contact information of the Code of Conduct team and the Conference Chair, important emergency numbers, and basic guidelines that volunteers should follow. Having a checklist is helpful in stressful situations.
- See the [Geek Feminism wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy_resources#Educate_conference_staff) for more information.

## Receiving harassment reports
If someone reports harassment to conference staff, ask them for a written account of what happened. This should be kept confidential to the Code of Conduct Team and Conference Chair (maximum of three people).

If conference staff receive a verbal report, they should themselves write down what they were told as soon as they can, in case they’re not able to follow up. A verbal report lasting more than a minute or so is probably better conducted in a quiet/private place rather than in a general convention space, for the safety and comfort of the reporter. This also decreases the chances that someone will overhear sensitive information that the reporter may not want spread around to the entire event.

If the following information is not volunteered in the written or verbal report, ask for it/include it, but do not pressure them.
Identifying information (name) of the participant doing the harassing

- The behavior that was in violation
- The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time the report was made)
- The circumstances surrounding the incident
- Other people involved in the incident

Generally conference staff are not equipped for evidence gathering: we suggest not going around and "interviewing" others involved.

## Initial response to harassment reports

### In case of threats to physical well-being
Most harassment complaints aren't of this nature, but if someone reports that an attendee has committed or is threatening violence towards another attendee, or other safety issues:
- if there is any general threat to attendees or the safety of anyone including conference staff is in doubt, summon security or police.
- if everyone is presently physically safe, involve law enforcement or security only at a victim's request. In many cases, reporting harassment to law enforcement is very unpleasant and may result in further harassment. A staff member can provide the list of emergency contacts and say something like "if you want any help reporting this incident, please let us know" and leave it at that.

### All other reports
- offer the victim a private place to sit
- ask "is there a friend or trusted person who you would like to be with you?" (if so, arrange for someone to fetch this person)
- ask them "how can I help?"
- re-assure them that the matter will be handled by the conference staff.
  - Simply say "Thanks, this sounds like a breach of our anti-harassment policy. I am going to convene a meeting of a small group of people and figure out what our response will be."
  - Or, if the incident was of a very private matter, say: “If you're OK with it I am going to convene a meeting of a small group of people and figure out what our response will be." Pause, and see if they say they do not want this. Otherwise, go ahead.

### Things not to do:
- Do not overtly invite them to withdraw the complaint or mention that withdrawal is OK: this suggests that you want them to do so, and is therefore coercive. "If you're OK with it [pursuing the complaint]" suggests that you are by default pursuing it and is not coercive.
- Do not ask for their advice on how to deal with the complaint: this is the staff's responsibility
- Do not offer them input into penalties: this is the staff's responsibility
- Do not share details of the people involved or incident without specific permission from the victim. This includes sharing with other staff.

## Staff action in response to harassment reports
You should aim to take action as soon as reasonably possible. During the event, a response within the next half-day is usually an appropriate timeframe. After the event you may need more time to gather sufficient decision makers, but ideally responding within the same week or sooner is good.

### Meeting
Available staff (Code of Conduct Team and Conference Chair) should meet as soon as possible after a report to discuss:
- what happened?
- are we doing anything about it?
- who is doing those things?
- when are they doing them?

**Neither the complainant nor the alleged harasser should attend.** (If the event was very widely witnessed, such as a harassing talk, this may be an exception to this guideline.) People with a conflict of interest should exclude themselves or if necessary be excluded by others.

### Communicate with the alleged harasser about the complaint
As soon as possible, either before or during the above meeting, let the alleged harasser know that there is a complaint about them, let them tell someone their side of the story and that person takes it into the meeting.

### Communicate with the harasser about the response
As soon as possible after that meeting, let the harasser know what action is being taken. Give them a place to appeal to if there is one, but in the meantime the action stands. "If you'd like to discuss this further, please contact XYZ, but in the meantime, you must <something something>"

### Communicate with the victim about the complaint
After action has been taken, communicate with the victim to let them know about your decision and sanctions made towards the harasser.


## Possible sanctions
Your guiding principle should be the safety of your community members from harassment and you should evaluate sanctions in light of whether they provide the safety needed. You and your event are the only people who can judge appropriate sanctions in your community based on the nature of the incident and the responses of the people involved, but some possibilities are:

- warning the harasser to cease their behaviour and that any further reports will result in sanctions
- requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with, and physical proximity to, their victim for the remainder of the event
- ending a talk that violates the policy early
- not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the policy
- not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks at this conference events
- immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges the harasser holds
- requiring that the harasser not volunteer for future events your organization runs (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
- requiring that the harasser refund any travel grants and similar they received (this would need to be a condition of the grant at the time of being awarded)
- requiring that the harasser immediately leave the event and not return
- banning the harasser from future events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
- removing a harasser from membership of relevant organizations
- [publishing an account of the harassment](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Name_and_shame) and calling for the resignation of the harasser from their responsibilities (usually pursued by people without formal authority: may be called for if the harasser is the event leader, or refuses to stand aside from the conflict of interest, or similar, typically event staff have sufficient governing rights over their space that this isn't as useful)

### Employer reports
If someone harassed someone else while in an official employee capacity, such as while working as paid event staff, while giving a talk about their employer's product, while staffing a sponsor booth, while wearing their employer's branded merchandise, while attempting to recruit someone for a job, or while claiming to represent their employer's views, it may be appropriate to provide a short report of their conduct to their employer.

### Don't require or encourage apologies
We do not suggest asking for an apology to the victim. You have no responsibility to enforce friendship, reconciliation, or anything beyond lack of harassment between any two given attendees, and in fact doing so can contribute to someone's lack of safety at your event.
Forcing a victim of harassment to acknowledge an apology from their harasser forces further contact with their harasser. It also creates a social expectation that they will accept the apology, forgive their harasser, and return their social connection to its previous status.

If the harasser offers to apologize to the victim (especially in person), we suggest strongly discouraging it. If a staff member relays an apology to the victim, it should be brief and not require a response. ("X apologizes and agrees to have no further contact with you" is brief. "X is very sorry that their attempts to woo you were not received in the manner that was intended and will try to do better next time, they're really really sorry and hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive them" is emphatically not.)

If the harasser attempts to press an apology on someone who would clearly prefer to avoid them, or attempts to recruit others to relay messages on their behalf, this may constitute continued harassment.

## Guidance on giving warnings to harassers

The most common sanction used is “a verbal or written warning”. It’s never an easy conversation to have and it’s always good to be prepared for it.

Few things to keep in mind:
- Make sure to give a warning in a private space, ideally an empty room. There should be at least two people giving a warning (ideally a Conference Chair, and Code of Conduct team). Ask the harasser to speak with you in a private space.
- Be calm, firm and in control. Don’t go into too much detail, you shouldn’t make the harasser aware of who reported the incident. Describe that you’ve been made aware of *details of the situation* and tell them that this is in violation of the Code of Conduct.
- Given situation, the conference staff decided to take a following action, and describe clearly what’s expected of the person you’re speaking to.
- Pause to let them react, and then acknowledge their input. Do not get involved into discussion on who is right or not.
- Make sure they know that they should don’t get involved into conversation with the victim or try to apologize, as this can be considered a further harassment.

> Examples of email warnings and/or verbal warnings. How to approach the “difficult conversation” with someone who broke the code of conduct. What kind of language to use? How to make sure harasser is aware they’ve done something wrong? What to do if they get defensive?

## Communication with the public
The community needs to see the policy enforced because:
- you want to be transparent to your community and not have secret policies and sanctions that you aren't accountable for
the actions of the harasser, or reports of multiple harassment, show that your policy may not be well understood
- you wish to reassure people that you are serious about anti-harassment

### Level of detail
When discussing the incident with others, it is good to keep the individuals anonymous, generally. (An exception may be if the harasser is very central to the community, such as a core conference staffer.) However, it is useful to:
- offer some idea of the nature of the incident eg "a sexual slide was shown in a talk" or "an attendee physically threatened another attendee" or "an attendee repeatedly harassed another attendee despite multiple requests to cease" or whatever.
- briefly mention the sanction
- (briefly! neutrally!) convey any apologies from the harasser, especially if they were backed by actions, for example "the [attendee/speaker/staffer] has agreed that their actions were inappropriate and has voluntarily left the conference"

This helps your community understand the reality of the policy: how and when it gets enforced.

### During the event
Inform the attendees. If the event has been dealt with at the conference, it may be appropriate for the conference to make a short announcement at the next break, something like: *"<thing> happened. This was a violation of our policy. We apologise for this. We have taken <action>. This is a good time for all attendees to review our policy at <location>. If anyone would like to discuss this further they can <contact us somehow>."* And then move on with the program.

### After the event
Publish a Code of Conduct transparency report, summarising all actions and incidents that took place during the event. [See a good example here](http://blog.djangounderthehood.com/post/132867126995/coc-transparency-report).

Again, try not to go into much detail, but explain the nature of the incidents and actions taken by the conference staff.
Post-event reporting tasks

### Report the incidents to the DSF Code of Conduct committee
It’s important to make sure that the DSF’s Code of Conduct committee is aware that an incident happened. This helps to detect common patterns, and makes everyone safe.

After the event, send a separate email to the conduct@djangoproject.com for each incident that took place. Example report:

    When: Date, time
    Where: Conference party at Django* conference
    What happened:
    *insert name* overheard one of our attendees (later identified as *insert name*) speaking to his friends and saying something along the lines of "*insert quote*". The reporter went to this person on quietly asked them to tone it down. They got very confrontational (not physically) and insisted that it wasn't actually inappropriate. It was reminded him that our CoC applies but that didn't really stop them.

    The conference staff decided to talk to this person the next day.
    So on *day*, *name of the people* took him aside to an empty room and went over what happened, explaining our stance on the issue and the reason why we don't accept it.
    The harasser immediately apologized on their own (without any prompt from us). They said that after thinking on it, they realized fully how their behavior was wrong and they thanked us for stepping in.
    The whole meeting lasted about 10 minutes, was very calm and overall successful.

    The conference staff decided not to take any further action and consider the case closed. We are forwarding this report to this board to keep a trace of it in the case of a repeated event in the past or future. We do not expect you to act on this, only to acknowledge the receipt of this report.

### Make an internal report
It’s important to internally (among your conference staff) to keep track of incident handling reports, so we can early detect patterns of behaviour, or keep attendees safe by not allowing harassers who were warned multiple times to attend the event.

Each event should have a central Google Spreadsheet to gather report incidents. The data stored in the spreadsheet should be brief, and include following details:
- Who reported the incident? Name and email.
- Who received the report, and was handling the incident? Names and emails of conference staff members.
- When & where the incident took place.
- Brief details of the incident -- what happened? Don’t go into detail, something like “behaviour after use of alcohol made another attendee feel uncomfortable” is enough.
- Describe action taken by conference staff.
- Who else know about the incident? Was it reported to the DSF?

## Data retention

Your internal track of incidents should be kept as safe as possible, and contain as little information as possible, but enough to make sure it’s actually useful to prevent from harassers attending your event.

A minimal number of people should be able to access the Spreadsheet. Make sure to share it with only specific people -- ideally only Conference Chair and Code of Conduct team should be able to access it.

When the Conference Chair or Code of Conduct team changes, the access should be removed and shared with appropriate people.

Records about incidents that only resulted in warnings should be stored for a period of 2 years only. All other reports should be stored indefinitely.

The spreadsheet should be checked frequently by the Conference Chair during the ticket registration period to make sure people who register to the conference are not banned from the conference.

## Known harasser registered to the event

- If the person who registered for your event was banned from attending Django* events, cancel their ticket, refund the payment and send an email saying that this person is not welcome on any Django related events.
- If the person is known to you as harasser, and you don’t feel comfortable having them on your event, send them an email offering a full refund.
- If the person is known to you as harasser, but you feel it’s okay for them to attend, keep a close eye and/or have a chat with this person on the first day of the conference, saying that you hope that they’re aware of the Code of Conduct during the event and events surrounding the conference.
