# Inclusivity

One of the important things you should do is starting to think about CoC
as about the tool in organizer's toolbelt to make the event more inclusive.
By encouraging good behaviour and proactive actions you will make the event
safer and more accessible.

By increasing inclusivity of your event, you send a clear message,
that you are trying to create a safe and friendly environment.
By setting an example of good and appropriate behaviours you give
the chance to the attendees to understand the expectactacions
regarding their behaviour, too. You are setting a standard.

There is a number of things that will increase inclusivity of your event
and build awarness of variety of possible problems.

The list below contains number of things you could try to implement. The list is
not comprehensive. Do not worry if you cannot cover all the points below if it's not
possible. However, the more you'll invest in these, the more fiendly and welcoming your event
will be.

* Make sure that your venue is accessible and is appropriate for people with movement impariments.

* Have a quiet room available for attendees. In this room people are not supposed to talk and
this is the space reserved for those who need an alone-time. By default people who are
in the room does not want to be disturbed.

* Have a room available for speakers, where they could reherse their talk, relax before
their talk or work on their slides.

* It is also encouraged to have a prayer room - make sure that people are not
disturbed there and the space meets necessary requirements of people using it.
Make sure to check with attendees who expressed interest in using the room what they would require.

* Make sure that people know where are the bathrooms, where food will be served, in which rooms
talks, events, workshops are happening. You could provide the map or add information
about it on your website. Clear labeling is also important: add posters with names,
agenda and arrows pointing to the correct place if necessary.

* If possible provide speech-to-text during your event. It not only allows people
with hearing impariments to participate fully in your event, but it also allows
people who are not native speakers of the language your event is using to follow
the content more easily. Having speech-to-text during your event has the extra benefit
of having a subtitles you could later add to video recordings of the talks if you publish
them after the event.

* Provide childcare to allow parents (especially single parents) to attend your event.

* Make sure organizers, Code of Conduct response team and volunteers are visible in the venue and ready to answer questions of the attendees or direct them to person who will be able to help them. One of the way to achieve that is by using different badges color.

* Make sure people at your event knows about important things. Make your MC to announce things like:
any changes in the schedule, where the food is served, where workshops are held etc.

* Make sure to provide food and drink options that acommodate everyone (both during the
main event and during the parties and speaker's dinner). Check with attendees what kind of
diet they require. Don't assume that there are only two options: "meat" and "vegetarian". Add 
extra field in your registration form, where people could write what they could eat.
If something is not clear, you should reach out to them and ask for more details.
During the parties, make sure to have non-alcoholic options, too. By serving alcoholic
drinks only, you exclude large part of the community: people whos religion does not
allows drinking, pregnant, people with various health issues, people recovering from
alcohol addiction.

* If you plan to have a professional photographer at the event, it is a good idea to introduce
different badges for attendees. Those who are not fine with being photographed, will
have a way to clearly state it. Make sure to inform the attendees about the policy and
ask them to respect the wish of people with no-photo badges.

* If you expect to have attendees that are travelling from different countries, make
sure to sell tickets well in advance. Applying for visa is a long process and might take couple
of weeks.

* If the venue has only two types of bathroom, make sure to add posters encouraging people
to use ones that they are most comfortable with. See next section for poster examples that
worked for us.

* One of the nice things to add in the bathrooms is a small box with bathroom supplies: things like
toothbrushes, toothpaste, deodorants, tampons, shampoos and so on. Some people might have no
time to find an open shop to get something they forgot to take with themselves. You might
consider having painkillers available, too, but you need to make sure that no minors have
access to them and the amount provided is small. One of the solutions might be having them available
at the registration desk for people who need it. Make sure to buy them individually packed.

* Moderating Q&A after talks is a good idea. "Well actualy's" and "it's a comment, not a question"
is not suitable for question time. Make sure to inform attendees that you have this policy
and encourage attendees to reach to the speaker after talk and question time to discuss the topic.

* During Q&A make sure to repeat the question if not everyone in the room was able to hear the question.

* If attendees are not from the country or city the event is organized, it's a good
idea to give them some useful tips, like: how the public transport looks like, how to
get a mobile coverage, where to look for help if needed. 

* Create a way attendees could meet each other before the event. Slack channel ot mailing list
will allow people to look for cheaper, shared accomodation, meet virtually and help
first-time goers to feel less intimidated and alone.

* If possible provide a financial assistance for people who overwise won't be able to come. Make sure people know about critera you take into account when you decide who will get the financial aid. 

* If you want to make it easier for first-time speakers to join your event,
you can offer mentoring program. This might vary from helping with drafting the
talk, speaking tips to proof-reading the content.

* It is important to have a clear information about price and time of realeaasing tickets.
Make sure you place the info visibly on the website and share in social media.

* Make sure your website is accessible - check if the person with sight empairments
will be able to access the information they need?

* Resign from one "unisex" t-shirts. You can explore more gender-neutral alternatives (i.e. socks)
for the swag or make sure you have different sizes and fits available. In this case,
you should make sure to collect information about sizes in advance.

* If you have official account or hashtag on Twitter or other social media you use
during the event, make sure to answer questions from attendees.

* Make sure your agenda is diverse when it comes to speakers.

* Make space and support initiatives that aims to increase diversity, such as: Django Girls, Pyladies, Trans*Code etc.. 

* Add some posters to make people feel welcome and excited. Something as simple as: "You look awesome" or "Welcome" makes a difference.
