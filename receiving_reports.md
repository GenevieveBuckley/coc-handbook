# Receiving reports

If someone reports harassment to conference staff, ask them for a written account of what happened. This should be kept confidential to the Code of Conduct Team and Conference Chair (maximum of three people).

If conference staff receive a verbal report, they should themselves write down what they were told as soon as they can, in case theyâ€™re not able to follow up. A verbal report lasting more than a minute or so is probably better conducted in a quiet/private place rather than in a general convention space, for the safety and comfort of the reporter. This also decreases the chances that someone will overhear sensitive information that the reporter may not want spread around to the entire event.

If the following information is not volunteered in the written or verbal report, ask for it/include it, but do not pressure them.
Identifying information (name) of the participant doing the harassing

- The behavior that was in violation
- The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time the report was made)
- The circumstances surrounding the incident
- Other people involved in the incident

Generally conference staff are not equipped for evidence gathering: we suggest not going around and "interviewing" others involved.

## Ways to receive reports

There are several ways to receive reports and making sure there are different 
option available, increases the chance that people will feel comfortable to 
report.

Ways you could receive the report:
* verbally, when the reporter contact one of your CoC staff or one of the 
organizers;
* by e-mail;
* by one of the CoC phones;
* by Twitter - this is discouraged way to report, especially if it's not a 
private message, since it exposes involved sides. However, you need to 
make sure that CoC response team is monitoring official Twitter account and 
event's hashtag if it exists.
