# Things to avoid

- Do not overtly invite them to withdraw the complaint or mention that withdrawal is OK: this suggests that you want them to do so, and is therefore coercive. "If you're OK with it [pursuing the complaint]" suggests that you are by default pursuing it and is not coercive.
- Do not ask for their advice on how to deal with the complaint: this is the staff's responsibility
- Do not offer them input into penalties: this is the staff's responsibility
- Do not share details of the people involved or incident without specific permission from the victim. This includes sharing with other staff.
