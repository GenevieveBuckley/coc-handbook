# Initial response

You should aim to take action as soon as reasonably possible. During the event, a response within the next half-day is usually an appropriate timeframe. After the event you may need more time to gather sufficient decision makers, but ideally responding within the same week or sooner is good.

### In case of threats to physical well-being
Most harassment complaints aren't of this nature, but if someone reports that an attendee has committed or is threatening violence towards another attendee, or other safety issues:
- if there is any general threat to attendees or the safety of anyone including conference staff is in doubt, summon security or police.
- if everyone is presently physically safe, involve law enforcement or security only at a victim's request. In many cases, reporting harassment to law enforcement is very unpleasant and may result in further harassment. A staff member can provide the list of emergency contacts and say something like "if you want any help reporting this incident, please let us know" and leave it at that.

### All other reports
- offer the victim a private place to sit
- ask "is there a friend or trusted person who you would like to be with you?" (if so, arrange for someone to fetch this person)
- ask them "how can I help?"
- re-assure them that the matter will be handled by the conference staff.
  - Simply say "Thanks, this sounds like a breach of our anti-harassment policy. I am going to convene a meeting of a small group of people and figure out what our response will be."
  - Or, if the incident was of a very private matter, say: â€œIf you're OK with it I am going to convene a meeting of a small group of people and figure out what our response will be." Pause, and see if they say they do not want this. Otherwise, go ahead.
