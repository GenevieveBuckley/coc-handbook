# Write up internal report

It's very useful to start writing internal report as soon as possible, even before
taking any action or talking to anyone else outside your Response Team.

Unless the time sensitive reaction is needed and you don't have time to
write everything down immediately, we recommend writing down report on the spot.

Taking the time to write down all the details as clearly as possible, will allow you
to catch all the little things you wouldn't otherwise thought of before jumping
to conclusions. Writing your thoughts down is really valuable, and we've been
proved over and over again that this process lets you see things that otherwise
go unseen.

It will help you:

- look at the incident objectively and in more organized way,
- make your final report more accurate, as you won't get a chance
to forget any details - this is especially important if the incident was
reported verbally,
- prepare yourself to the possible talk with the involved sides,
- compare the incident with previous ones you dealt,
- make sure that all Code of Conduct team actions are described and
documented.

Make sure to document things as soon as they happen. Add description of
the talks with each involved sides after you come back from the meeting,
document when and who did what. Don't rely on your memory and don't leave
it for later, especially that after the event it will be much harder
to meet with the whole Code of Conduct team to finish the report.

## Content

The internal report should contain following information (but should not be limited
to only that):

* who, when, where, how the incident was reported?
* who received the report - it's especially important in case of verbal reports;
* when and where the reported incident happened
* who was involved?
* description of the received report: what happened? - make sure to state clearly
who is a victim or who feels offended or uncomfortable,
* describe any planned actions taken:
    - if you decide to speak with involved sides, document who will meet and talk to them,
    - write down reactions of the involved sides on your Code of Conduct process -
does the offender feels sorry? Or do they cause further problems?
    - document if you send any e-mails or ask any third parties for input and why,
* describe any decisions about further actions:
    - does the situation will be reported to anyone?
    - does the conference organizers or Code of Conduct team need to do anything?
* if the offender is causing problems during the Code of Conduct process
make sure to document it too. Copy e-mails or make screenshots whenever applicable.
