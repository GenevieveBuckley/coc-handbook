# Write up internal report

It is very useful to start writing internal report as soon as possible. 
Unless the time sensitive reaction is needed and you have no time to 
write everything down imediatelly, we recommend writing down report on the spot.

It will help you:
- look at the incident objectively and in more organized way,
- writing down everything accuratelly, before you will get a chance 
to forget any details - this is especially important if the incident was
reported verbally,
- prepare yourself to the possible talk with the involved sides,
- compare the incident with previous ones you dealt,
- making sure that all Code of Conduct team actions are described and 
documented.

Make sure to document things as soon as they happen. Add description of 
the talks with each involved sides after you come back from the meeting, 
document when and who did what. Don't rely on your memory and don't leave 
it for later, especially that after the event it will be much harder 
to meet with the whole Code of Conduct team to finish the report. 

## Content

The internal report should contain following information (but should not be limited 
to only that):
* who, when and where reported the incident? 
* who received the report - it's especially important in case of verbal reports;
* when and when the reported incident happened and who was involved?
* description of the received report: what happened? - make sure to state clearly
who is a victim or who feels offended or uncomfortable,
* describe actions taken:
    - if you decide to speak with involved sides, document who will meet and talk to them,
    - write down reactions of the involved sides on your Code of Conduct process - 
does the offender feels sorry? Or do they cause further problems?
    - document if you send any e-mails or ask any third parties for input and why,
* describe any decisions about further actions:
    - does the situation will be reported to anyone?
    - does the conference organizers or Code of Conduct team need to do anything? Example actions we 
had to take are: removing slide(s) or whole talk from later publications/recordings, 
asking to remoe inappropriate tweets, reporting to DSF, etc..
* if the offender is causing problems during the Code of Conduct process 
make sure to document it, too. Copy e-mails, make tweet's screeenshot
when applicable.
