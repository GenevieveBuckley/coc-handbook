## Guidance on giving warnings to harassers

The most common sanction used is “a verbal or written warning”. It’s never an easy conversation to have and it’s always good to be prepared for it.

Few things to keep in mind:
- Make sure to give a warning in a private space, ideally an empty room. There should be at least two people giving a warning (ideally a Conference Chair, and Code of Conduct team). Ask the harasser to speak with you in a private space.
- Be calm, firm and in control. Don’t go into too much detail, you shouldn’t make the harasser aware of who reported the incident. Describe that you’ve been made aware of *details of the situation* and tell them that this is in violation of the Code of Conduct.
- Given situation, the conference staff decided to take a following action, and describe clearly what’s expected of the person you’re speaking to.
- Pause to let them react, and then acknowledge their input. Do not get involved into discussion on who is right or not.
- Make sure they know that they should don’t get involved into conversation with the victim or try to apologize, as this can be considered a further harassment.
