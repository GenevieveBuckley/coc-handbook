# Team meeting

Available staff (Code of Conduct Team and Conference Chair) should meet as soon as possible after a report to discuss:
- what happened?
- are we doing anything about it?
- who is doing those things?
- when are they doing them?

**Neither the complainant nor the alleged harasser should attend.** (If the event was very widely witnessed, such as a harassing talk, this may be an exception to this guideline.) People with a conflict of interest should exclude themselves or if necessary be excluded by others.
