# Team meeting

Available staff - ideally whole Code of Conduct Response Team or as many members 
of the team as possible - should meet immediately after receiving a report to:

- discuss what happened and what is the current situation;
- decide if you need to speak with involved sides;
- decide on possible actions, but make sure to not make them definite and base 
them depending on person reaction. For instance, the sanctions might be different 
if the offender feels sorry for their actions or if they are defensive and 
angry about the report. It may also depend on whether their actions were deliberate or they intended no harm. Most Code of Conduct incidents reach a common understanding, and giving people a warning to allow them to correct their actions in the future is the key;
- try to document these steps in your internal report;
- decide who is going to speak with involved sides - ideally two people: 
woman and man;
- decide when you should talk to involved sides.

**Neither the complainant nor the alleged harasser should attend.** 
People with a conflict of interest should exclude themselves or if necessary be excluded by others.

If the event was widely witnessed, make sure that you let people know that the Code of Conduct team is taking care of the issue.
