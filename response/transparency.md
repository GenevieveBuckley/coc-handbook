# Transparency


## Communication with the public
The community needs to see the policy enforced because:
- you want to be transparent to your community and not have secret policies and sanctions that you aren't accountable for
the actions of the harasser, or reports of multiple harassment, show that your policy may not be well understood
- you wish to reassure people that you are serious about anti-harassment

### Level of detail
When discussing the incident with others, it is good to keep the individuals anonymous, generally. (An exception may be if the harasser is very central to the community, such as a core conference staffer.) However, it is useful to:
- offer some idea of the nature of the incident eg "a sexual slide was shown in a talk" or "an attendee physically threatened another attendee" or "an attendee repeatedly harassed another attendee despite multiple requests to cease" or whatever.
- briefly mention the sanction
- (briefly! neutrally!) convey any apologies from the harasser, especially if they were backed by actions, for example "the [attendee/speaker/staffer] has agreed that their actions were inappropriate and has voluntarily left the conference"

This helps your community understand the reality of the policy: how and when it gets enforced.

### During the event
Inform the attendees. If the event has been dealt with at the conference, it may be appropriate for the conference to make a short announcement at the next break, something like: *"<thing> happened. This was a violation of our policy. We apologise for this. We have taken <action>. This is a good time for all attendees to review our policy at <location>. If anyone would like to discuss this further they can <contact us somehow>."* And then move on with the program.

### After the event
Publish a Code of Conduct transparency report, summarising all actions and incidents that took place during the event. [See a good example here](http://duth-blog.tumblr.com/post/132867126995/coc-transparency-report).

Again, try not to go into much detail, but explain the nature of the incidents and actions taken by the conference staff.
