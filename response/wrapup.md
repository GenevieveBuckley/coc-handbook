# Team meeting & followups

After having "the talk" with an offender, it's time to come back and meet the rest
of your Response Team. Hopefully, your talk went well, and it's now time for a wrap-up.

However, if the talk didn't went well, and you think that decision about sanction
should be reconsidered, that's a time to do it. We recommend going back to the
second point "Team meeting" and following the same guidance again.

## Wrap up

Wrap up part is equally important to all other steps. It's important to close the
loops, follow up with everyone involved, and properly close the incident.

There are several steps involved:

### Finish the report

It's time to finish the report you started in "Write up initial report" chapter.
Add few words about how the incident was resolved, summarize your conversation
and proof read it again to make sure all necessary information is there.

### Follow-up emails

#### Communicate with the alleged harasser about the complaint

Send a summary of the incident and actions taken to the alleged harasser. If appropriate,
thank them for a smooth cooperation to resolve the situation. Keep it short, and to
the point.

Example email:


#### Communicate with the victim about the complaint

Communicate with the victim to let them know about your decision and sanctions made towards the harasser.
Thank them for doing the right thing, and reporting the situation to you. Make sure
they are aware that if they need any further help, you're there for them.

Example email:


### Report the incidents to the DSF Code of Conduct committee
