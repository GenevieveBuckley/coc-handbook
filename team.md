# Response Team

Even the best Code of Conduct won't make any difference if it is not 
handled well.  
Having Code of Conduct but not being able to enforce it give false feeling of safety. 
Wrong CoC handling might expose sensitive information about involved sides, 
result in Internet flame wars, people loosing jobs and making people not 
wanting to report anything in a future. 

You should be careful when choosing your Response Team and make sure they are
aware what kind of challenges they might face during CoC duty. 

## Size & Structure

It's important to have the right size of the Response Team. Too big will 
make decision making too slow and ineffective and there is a chance of 
diffusion of responsibility. Too small will put too much 
stress, pressure and responsiblity on one or two people's shoulders. 

So far the best Response Team that worked for us was consisting of 4 people: 
two women and two men.

If possible, try to have people from underrepresented groups in your response 
team.

## Responsibilities

Code of Conduct handling has to be main responsiblity 
of the person and have priority over anything else. 
Make sure every member of the team is not responsible for anything crucial 
for running your event.

Every member of the team should have access to the CoC e-mail and be able to 
receive reports. 

If possible whole team should be involved in handling each incident, 
but in case it is impossible and the issue is time sensitive, each member 
should be allowed to make necessary decisions in name of the whole team. 
However, it should be an exception reserved to very time-sensitive situations.

If any of the members of CoC team is involved in the incident, the person 
is excluded from decision making. 

## Choosing Team Members

Make sure that all Response Team members:

* are fimiliar with this document, understand and agree with the process;
* don't have any important responsibilities at the event;
* are available during your whole event and are very responsive;
* represent very high level of empathy and you trust their judgment;
* are aware that the work is emotionally draining and working in CoC team won't 
affect their well-being;

It is not required that conference chair or main event organizer is a part of 
the team. 

## Power

Code of Conduct team is independent from the conference organizers and 
conference chair. Organizers of the event are not allowed to influence CoC 
response team decisions.
