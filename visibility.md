# Code of Conduct visibility

One of the most important things to do before and during the event is 
making sure that everyone knows about existence of Code of Conduct and 
have no problems to find details about it. Failing to communicate about it 
might cause unnecessary discussions in case of problems or might discourage 
some people from attending the event.

Here is a list of things that help to increase visibility of the Code of Conduct:

* reading and agreeing to your Code of Conduct should be obligatory when registering ticket for the event;
* make sure to link your CoC in both header and footer on your website;
* prepare and print posters about CoC;
* remind about Code of Conduct during welcome talks, at the registration desk 
and on other possible occasions;
* remind about the Code of Conduct in e-mail communication with attendees.

## Website

Make sure Code of Conduct is easily found and accessible on your website. 
It is important to link to it from the homepage, ideally both in header and 
footer. 

Use consistent naming, ideally always use "Code of Conduct" or "CoC" names, 
so people will be able to find the link immediately. 

### Code of Conduct Page

A Code of Conduct page is one of the primary sources of information about it for
all of your attendees. It is also a place where you link to whenever you 
write or mention Code of Conduct. That is why it is crucial to have this 
done right.

The page should contain following information:

* short and long version of your Code of Conduct. See example [here](https://2016.djangocon.eu/coc/);
* how CoC violation could be reported: 

    * e-mail address that is entirely dedicated to CoC,
    * phone numbers: one to female and one to male member of staff,
    * emergency numbers (Fire, Medical, Police numbers with country code);

* names and photos of your Code of Conduct response team, so people 
will have no problem to identify them if needed;
* short list of things that might be reported to give people idea what is 
considered a Code of Conduct violation;
* link to this document to let people know about your process.

## Posters

Posters informing about your Code of Conduct will increase visibility and 
remind attendees about it. We advice to hang them in the event venue
and if possible in any location where any official events are held: sprints venue,
party etc.. 

The poster should include:

* short version of your Code of Conduct
* link to the CoC page
* phone numbers and CoC e-mail address

## Links to Your Code of Conduct

There are a number of places where you should point people out to your Code of 
Conduct page:

* link it from header & footer on your website
* link to CoC when registering a ticket for your event
* link in e-mail communication with attendees
* tweet the link at the beginning of the event using your official Twitter account
